            # ==============================================================
            # Regarding the rotation below: it's a mess.
            # 
            # The rotation x,y,z we provide here is used by the code
            # that reads the GDML to conduct rotations,
            # first about X, then about the (new) Y,
            # then about the (newer) Z. This is an "intrinsic" rotation, as
            # opposed to an "extrinsic" one in which the axes don't change.
            # I verified this in some simple cases by rotating the TileStrip
            # and looking to see what it did in the geometry viewer.
            # This convention would be useful if we were sitting in an
            # airplane and rotating it. It's pretty counterintuitive in
            # the case that we are external to objects and placing and
            # rotating them in space. <sigh>
            # 
            # The code that ultimately does the rotation
            # is CLHEP::HepRotation. I was able to look at it and reconstruct
            # the combined rotation matrix R_t after the three rotations.
            # This matrix has three angles: theta_x, theta_y, theta_z and
            # it's written out in my notes.
            #
            # A scheme of rotations about all three of
            # X, Y and Z in some order is called a Tait-Bryan rotation:
            #      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles
            # This differs from Euler rotations in that the latter features
            # the same axis twice (e.g., ZXZ)
            #
            # By comparing my matrix R_t with the matrix on the wiki page
            # (specifically Tait-Bryan X_1 Y_2 Z_3)
            # I see they disagree by a transpose and by the
            # sign of the angles, at least theta_y. The transpose could
            # be the difference between an active and passive transformation.
            # The wiki page says the matricies correspond to active
            # transformations and passive ones can be found as the
            # transpose. Also, I know my matrix corresponds to an intrinsic
            # rotation. Together these differences may explain the transpose
            # and sign issues.
            #
            # My method for finding the right rotation is desribed below.
            # 
            # The original orientation of the strip can be described by
            # two vectors:
            #
            # The first vector is a=(0,0,1), the vector normal
            # to the strip, pointing away from the third layer. We eventually
            # want this to point in the radial direction in cylindrical
            # coordinates, so the first layer of the strips (copper absorber)
            # faces inward. That direction is alpha=(cos(phi),sin(phi),0)
            #
            # The second vector b=(1,0,0) is taken to point along the strip
            # as it was originally constructed. After rotation we want
            # beta=(0,0,1).

            #
            # We want
            #    alpha = R_t a
            # and
            #    beta  = R_t b
            #
            # The game is to explicitly evaluate the RHS and then
            # see how to make it match the LHS by picking theta_x,y,z.
            # After some trial and error I found that solutions that
            # actually worked came from using the transpose of my R_t,
            # and -sy -> sy.  I don't really understand this.
